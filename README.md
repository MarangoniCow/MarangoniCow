- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarangoniCow, Marangoni comes from a fluid dynamics phenomena called the Marangoni Effect, where internal flows in small droplets can be generated by gradients in surface tension. Cow is just a cow. Now you know.
- 👀 I’m interested in Research Software, that's code for backend that specialises in modelling things.
- 🌱 I’m currently working my way though various front-end libraries, right now I'm having intimate conversations with SDL2.
- 💞️ If you fancy it, you can help me improve my Chess AI which I've nicked named Zylo. He's loyal to me, but like a friendly dog, would be happy to say hello to you too.
- 📫 You can drop me a PM and I'll probably drop one back. If you need an idea of what sort of person I am, think of a happy golden retriever, and you'll be somewhat there :)
