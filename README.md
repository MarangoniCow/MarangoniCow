- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarangoniCow, Marangoni comes from a fluid dynamics phenomena called the Marangoni Effect, where internal flows in small droplets can be generated by gradients in surface tension. Cow is just a cow. Now you know.
- 👀 I’m interested in research software, fluid dynamics, and Octopush.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++, working my way round Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything small and fun I guess.
- 📫 Feel free to PM me here.
